\begin{acknowledgments}
I am very grateful to my advisor Prof. Hongfeng Yu for providing me the great opportunity to be a research assistant in computer science department. What make the work in this thesis possible are Prof. Yu's supervision and guidance. His criticisms and suggestions keep me working towards to the right direction.  
\vspace{10pt}

Thank to the kind and selfless help from our group members Feiyu Zhu, Lina Yu, Jianping Zeng as well as helpful discussions with Jieting Wu and Babak Jafarisamani, I can participate to different projects gaining the experiences of image processing and visualization techniques in approximately eight months in Prof. Yu's group. I am impressed and inspired by their expertise, diligence and tireless effort. 
\vspace{10pt}

I would like to thank Prof. Sheng Wei and Prof. Lisong Xu for being my committee members as well as their suggestions and advice to this work.
\vspace{10pt}

I would also like to thank Prof. Peter Dowben who is my PhD advisor in Physics Department and offers me tremendous support for pursuing this degree. In this work, a physics data set (LuFeO$_3$ PEEM images) has been studied. I would like to give acknowledgement to Prof. Xiaoshan Xu for the LuFeO$_3$ sample growth and give acknowledgement to Canadian Light Source as well as Dr. Jian Wang there for the help of taking data. The experiment on physics data was also supported by the National Science Foundation through NSF-ECCS–1508541 and the Nebraska Polarization and Spin Phenomena in Nanoferroic Structures (P-SPINS) MRSEC NSF DMR-1420645. 
\vspace{10pt}

I wish to acknowledge our collaborators Prof. Harkamal Walia and his group members as well as plant phenotyping facilities manage Dr. Vincent Stoerger for providing the plant image data and other helps.
\vspace{10pt}

I would like to thank graduate school's policy of University of Nebraska-Lincoln which allows students to participate into two graduate programs at the same time and eventually makes this thesis possible from the beginning.
\vspace{10pt}

Last but not least, I am grateful that I received unconditional support from my family during these years. The love from family keeps me alive and going forward.
