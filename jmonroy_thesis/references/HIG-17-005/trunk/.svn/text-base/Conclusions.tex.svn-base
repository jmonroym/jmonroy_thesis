\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
A search for the production of a Higgs boson in association with a single top quark has been presented, using the CMS detector and the full 2016 data sample of pp collisions at 13\TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9\fbinv.
Three channels have been analyzed, targeting the Higgs boson decaying to a pair of \PW\ or \Z\ bosons, or two \Pgt~leptons and the leptonic decay of the top: two same-sign leptons (\mumu, \emu) and three leptons.
This process can benefit from a greatly enhanced production cross section in the case of anomalous top-Higgs couplings, and the results are used to constrain these couplings.

Combining the results from all three channels yields a 95\% confidence level (C.L.) upper limit on the production cross section times branching ratio of events containing a SM Higgs boson of $0.56\,\mathrm{pb}$, with an expected limit of $0.24\,\mathrm{pb}$.% with inverted top quark coupling ($\Ct=-1.0$, $\CV=1.0$) of \textcolor{red}{XX} times the predicted value, where the expected limit was $0.7$.
%% FIXME: Need to write something about the excess

Values of the ratio of Higgs-top coupling modifier \Ct\ and Higgs-vector boson coupling modifier \CV\ are outside the range $-1.25$ to $+1.60$ are excluded at 95\% C.L.
